          Tigers are some of the most majestic (and largest!) big cats found around the world, often seen as the most beautiful big cat, the tiger is
          also one of the most endangered cats in the wild, with some subspecies of tiger already being completely killed off by human poaching
          or other causes, and the others dwindling in numbers at an alarming rate. Below you will find a selection of the six tiger subspecies found in the wild!

    <img src="BengalTiger.jpg" alt="Bengal Tiger Image" style="width:25%;"> <!--Bengal Image, sized to 25% of original size-->
    <!--Paragraph that tabs after reaching 60% of the page width-->
    <p style="width:60%;">Bengal Tigers are often regarded as the largest wild cats alive, residing in humid forests in India, Bangladesh, Nepal
      and Bhutan. Bengals have a coat yellowish to light orange, with stripes ranging from dark brown to black, the belly
      is white and the tail is orange with black rings. Although Bengals have been known to have several "mutations", such as
      white or pale golden fur (golden tiger) these are extremely rare to the point the former has only one confirmed sighting
      within the wild. Although like all Tiger subspecies the Bengal is an endangered species, it also has the healthiest
      population numbers-wise and the population is considered decreasing at the moment.

    <h2 id="Siberian">Siberian Tigers</h2>
    <img src="SiberianTiger.jpg" alt="Siberian Tiger Image" style="width:25%;"> <!--Siberian Image, sized to 25% of original size-->
    <!--Paragraph that tabs after reaching 60% of the page width-->
    <p style="width:60%;">Siberian Tigers are native to the Russian far east, Northeast China, and possibly North Korea. The Siberian is
      the only Tiger that lives in a snowy habitat, and is genetically close to the now-extinct Caspian Tiger. Siberian Tigers are on average the
      second largest of the subspecies, however some males have been known to grow to a size of 675 lbs. Their coats are a rusty reddish color, with
      narrow black stripes across its body. A Siberian's coat is moderately thick, helping with the colder weather of Eastern Russia. They are also
      endangered and have a population of around 400 or more in the wild with stable numbers.

    <h2 id="Sumatran">Sumatran Tigers</h2>
    <img src="SumatranTiger.jpg" alt="Sumatran Tiger Image" style="width:25%;"> <!--Sumatran Image, sized to 25% of original size-->
    <!--Paragraph that tabs after reaching 60% of the page width-->
    <p style="width:60%;">Sumatran Tigers are found fragmented across Sumatra, and are considered some of the smallest Tigers in terms of both
      height and weight. Although all tigers possess a strong ability to swim and enjoy swimming, Sumatran Tigers are considered the best swimmers
      alongside the Bengal due to adaptations to their enviroment. They live mainly within the rainforests of Sumatra and have a population of roughly
      400-600 in the wild, considered critically endangered with a decreasing population similar to the Indochinese and Malayan Tigers.

    <h2 id="Indochinese">Indochinese Tigers</h2>
    <!--Paragraph that tabs after reaching 60% of the page width-->
    <img src="IndochineseTiger.jpg" alt="Indochinese Tiger Image" style="width:25%;"> <!--Indochinese Image, sized to 25% of original size-->
    <!--Paragraph that tabs after reaching 60% of the page width-->
    <p style="width:60%;">Indochinese Tigers are native to Southeast Asia, specifically within Myanmar and Thailand, and possibly a very small numbers
      withing Vietnam. They live within tropical forests and hover around a population of 250, putting them at critically endangered status with a
      decreasing population. The Indochinese Tigers colouration is darker, with more rather short and narrow stripes. They are very good at utilizing
      camouflage, helping them with hunting their prey.
    </p>
    <br> <!--Line Break (Creates extra gap between elements)-->
    <h2 id="Malayan">Malayan Tigers</h2>
    <img src="MalayanTiger.jpg" alt="Malayan Tiger Image" style="width:25%;"> <!--Malayan Image, sized to 25% of original size-->
    <!--Paragraph that tabs after reaching 60% of the page width-->
    <p style="width:60%;">Malayan Tigers are native to the southern and central parts of the Malayasian Peninsula, and outside of the South China
      Tiger, is the smallest in numbers sitting at only 200 left in the wild, with an estimated 80 to 120 of those being mature adults. They are also Critically
      endangered with a steady decline in population due to development projects and agriculture, primarily involving palm oil production. There aren't
      many clear difference between the Malayan Tiger and the Indochinese Tiger, the former being on the smaller size at roughly half the height of other
      tigers, and on the lighter end in terms of weight.

    <br> <!--Line Break (Creates extra gap between elements)-->
    <h2 id="SouthChina">South China Tigers</h2>
    <img src="SouthChinaTiger.jpg" alt="South China Tiger Image" style="width:25%;"> <!--South China Image, sized to 25% of original size-->
    <!--Paragraph that tabs after reaching 60% of the page width-->
    <p style="width:60%;">South China Tigers were native to Southern China, however they are currently listed as Critically Endangered or even possibly
      extinct within the wild as the last confirmed sighting within the wild was back in the 1980's. Since the late 1990's continued survival for any potential
      survivors was considered extremely unlikely due to numerous amounts of factors such as prey density, widespread habitat degradation, and other
      environmental issues. Unfortunately despite efforts from local sanctuaries and zoos, the population even within captivity is still only around 100
      individuals. As of this time there are attempts to "rewild" the population back into South Africa. The South China Tiger is also considered to be the
      most ancient subspecies of tiger which all other subspecies descend from.
